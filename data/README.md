# Data Directory

This directory would contain the actual model data files in a real implementation.

## Expected Data Files

The model would typically require the following data files:

- `05_00_working_data.rds`: Working data for the salons, including:
  - County identifiers
  - Quarter-year identifiers
  - Location identifiers
  - Task mix proportions
  - Exogenous quality and cost factors
  - Customer prices
  - Population data
  - Employee allocation data

- `05_00_initial_wages.rds`: Initial wage data by:
  - County
  - Quarter-year
  - Worker skill set wages (w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)

- `02_00_parameters.rds`: Model parameters, including:
  - Price sensitivity (rho) by county
  - Worker skill sets (theta matrices)
  - Coordination costs by salon
  - Other market parameters

- `05_03_wages_salestax.rds`: Results from the sales tax counterfactual:
  - Wage changes by county, quarter, and equilibrium type
  - Productivity effects
  - s-index changes

- `05_03_prod_salestax.rds`: Detailed productivity data from the sales tax counterfactual

- `05_03_prod_initial.rds`: Baseline productivity data for comparison

## Data Format

All data files are expected to be in R's RDS format, which preserves R objects including data.tables and lists. The model functions expect these specific file names and structures.

## Data Generation

In a full implementation, these data files would be generated by running the full model as described in the paper. The code for generating this data is available in the original source code (`05_03_sales_tax.txt`).

## Placeholder Data

For demonstration purposes, the app currently uses simulated data based on the findings in the paper. To use real data:

1. Generate the actual RDS files using the full model
2. Place them in this directory
3. Modify the `model_functions.R` file to load and use the real data instead of the simulated data

## Requirements

The data files should be compatible with the following R packages:
- data.table
- rootSolve
- pracma
- BB
- SQUAREM
